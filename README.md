Instructions 
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository 

for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “*Individual household 

electric power consumption Data Set*” which I have made available on the course web site:  
  
Dataset: **Electric power consumption** [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute 

sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-

metering values are available.  
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:  

1. **Date**: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. **Time**: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. **Global\_active\_power**: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)  
4. **Global\_active\_power**: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)  
5. **Voltage**: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. **Global\_intensity**: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)  
7. **Sub\_metering\_1**: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It 

corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates 

are not electric but gas powered).  
8. **Sub\_metering\_2**: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It 

corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator 

and a light.  
9. **Sub\_metering\_3**: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It 

corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.  

In this submission we include the following files:

* R language programs 
    + **getFile.R**: Downloads the zip file. 
    + **readFile.R**: Read the unzipped file and selects the desired records. 
    + **plot1.R**: Perform the plot1 graphic and saves it as a png file.    
    + **plot2.R**: Perform the plot2 graphic and saves it as a png file.      
    + **plot3.R**: Perform the plot3 graphic and saves it as a png file.      
    + **plot4.R**: Perform the plot4 graphic and saves it as a png file.      
  
* png files
    + **plot1.png**: File saved by plot1.R program.  
    + **plot2.png**: File saved by plot1.R program.  
    + **plot3.png**: File saved by plot1.R program.  
    + **plot4.png**: File saved by plot1.R program.
